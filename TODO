* add group_by columns

    tabular data is often organized into many rows of data, grouped by
    one or more column values (the sub-rows may then be sorted, but that's
    another feature).

    eg: group_by=['header1', 'header2', ..]  # specify column names
     or group_by=[0, 1]                      # use origin-0 column indexes

    causes visual breaks in the presentation
    use "groupendline=" and "groupstartline=", but only if "group_by" present

* add sort_by columns

    much data is sorted by multiple columns, and tabulate should be able to
    help manage this without requiring multiple indexes to be prepared by the
    developer

    usage: sort_by=['map', 'order']
       or: sort_by=[0, 1]

    causes data to be indexed and ordered by the given sort columns
