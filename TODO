* add group_by columns

Tabular data is often organized into many rows of data, grouped by
one or more column values (the sub-rows may then be sorted, but that's
another feature).

usage:

    tabulate(somedata, group_by=['header1', 'header2', ..])

or
    tabulate(somedata, group_by=[0, 1])  # use origin-0 column indexes

The `group_by` feature causes visual breaks in the presentation
(a blank line, for example), when the values of the named
(or indexed) columns changes.

The code should use `group_by_start=` and `group_by_end=` configurations
for the various table configurations, but only if the `group_by`
parameter is present.

* add sort_by columns

Much data is sorted by multiple columns, and tabulate should be able to
help manage this without requiring multiple indexes to be prepared by the
developer.

Usage:

    tabulate(somedata, sort_by=['map', 'order'])
or
    tabulate(somedata, sort_by=[0, 1]) # use origin-0 column indexes

The `sort_by` parameter causes data to be indexed and ordered by the given sort columns.
